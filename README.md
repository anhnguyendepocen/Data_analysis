# Course material for the lecture "Tools for complex data analysis"

by Ralf B. Sch√§fer, University of Koblenz-Landau, Winter Semester 2018/19

## Overview

This repository provides all course materials including R code, slides and data as well as the links to teaching videos.
Note that all material comes without guarantee! In case you have any comments regarding content, 
please feel free to contact me, but note that I generally do not respond to computer issues or questions 
for statistical advice (unless working on a joint publication).

## Prerequisites

To prepare your computer for the lecture, you need to install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and 
[R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/). I use several packages in the course, if you want to have all packages 
ready at the beginning of the course, run the script 0_install_packgs.R in the Code folder. Note that 
the course is work in progress and you should run this script again from to time to time to be up to date with 
the packages required. Alternatively, you can just install a new package whenever it is needed:

```
install.packages("package_name")
```
